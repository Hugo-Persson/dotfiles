Create a GitHub Pull Request after implementing a feature following software engineering best practices.

**Workflow:**

1. **Branch Creation**
   - Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `feat/user-authentication`, `fix/api-validation`, `chore/update-dependencies`)
   - Use conventional commit prefixes: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`

2. **Code Quality Check**
   - Run `pnpm lint:fix:unsafe` to fix linting issues
   - Run `pnpm turbo type-check` to verify TypeScript
   - Run `pnpm test` to ensure all tests pass

3. **Commit Changes**
   - Stage all changes with `git add .`
   - Create commit with conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
   - Examples:
     - `feat(auth): add JWT authentication system`
     - `fix(api): resolve validation error handling`
     - `chore(deps): update dependencies to latest versions`

4. **Push and Create PR**
   - Push branch to origin
   - Use GitHub MCP server to create PR with:
     - **Title**: Clear, descriptive title following conventional commits
     - **Description**: Include:
       - What was changed and why
       - How to test the changes
       - Any breaking changes
